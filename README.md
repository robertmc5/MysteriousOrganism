# Mysterious Organism  

There's a new mysterious organism _Pila aequor_ (P. aequor), and it is only comprised of 15 DNA bases.  
This JavaScript project creates objects that simulate the DNA of P. aequor for the research team to study.  
It has functions that compare and analyze the DNA strands of the virtual organisms and log the results to the console.
